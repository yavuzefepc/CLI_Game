Sorry but your internship application was not accepted by any company.
But don't be upset, go back to Bootcamp folder and delete your lessons folders. You need to take these lessons again. That means after deleting your lessons, create new folders named "Advanced_Lessons1", "Advanced_Lessons2", "Advanced_Lessons3"...."Advanced_Lessons13" and come again. This time try to find the right folder in Internship folder and then you can start your internship.
Good Luck...
